A core research activity in many sciences concerns the gathering
of data through questionnaire-based surveys. On the other hand,
annotation projects which require input by field specialists become
invaluable in various areas of research by creating evaluation data
for automated methods. Surveys and annotation projects share sim-
ilarities, since they both depend on participants who are prompted
to answer a set of questions, optionally referring to a particular
artifact (e.g., a text segment). Both tasks are hindered by their de-
pendence on volunteers, who are reluctant to participate due to the
time required to be spent on them. Additionally, both tasks may
require participants of a particular background, thus burdening
the research conductors with the weight of finding suitable ones.
Despite their similarity, these tasks have been treated separately so
far and different tools have been developed to facilitate each one.
In this work we present SurvAnnT, a Web-based platform, which
facilitates the creation and management of surveys and annotation
projects. Our platform goes beyond existing tools, by providing a
set of customizable gamification aspects to motivate participation,
as well as by offering expert finding mechanisms to enable research
to locate suitable participants.
